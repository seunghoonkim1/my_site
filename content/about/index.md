Hi! A little bit about me. </br>

Data and operations have always been my passion. With a background in operations and supply chain management across the retail, cosmetics, and CPG industries, I discovered that data is at the heart of solving complex problems in these fields.</br>

Realizing the pivotal role of data, I dedicated myself to mastering the art of gathering, managing, and leveraging data to address everyday challenges encountered in my work and personal life. Data engineering and analysis have become integral parts of my professional identity, driving me to continually innovate and deliver effective solutions.
